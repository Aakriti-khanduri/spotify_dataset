# Song Valence Prediction and Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing a dataset of songs and predicting their **valence**â€”the emotional tone of the song, indicating how positive or negative the song feels.

## Description

The project aims to perform **data analysis** on a dataset of songs, and use machine learning to predict the **valence** (emotional tone) of each song. It includes preprocessing the data, extracting relevant features from song attributes like tempo, genre, and duration, and applying machine learning models to make predictions.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for song attributes.
- Building and training machine learning models for valence prediction.
- Visualizations showing the trends in the dataset (e.g., genre-based valence scores, tempo vs. valence).
- Model evaluation to assess performance (accuracy, precision, recall).

## Data Analysis
The dataset used contains various song attributes, including:
- Tempo
- Genre
- Duration
- Danceability
- Loudness
- Energy
- Key features extracted for analysis: **valence** prediction.

The analysis helps to uncover trends and patterns related to how the different features (like tempo or genre) influence the emotional tone of the songs.

## Valence Prediction Models
We applied different machine learning models to predict the **valence** of a song. The project demonstrates how models like **Random Forest**.
